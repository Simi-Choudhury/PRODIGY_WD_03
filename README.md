This is the project of Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application.  By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, I  created an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other , aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
